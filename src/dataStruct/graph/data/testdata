Challenge SCC ata set:
    This file describes the edges of a directed graph.
    Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714.
    Each row indicates one edge of the graph (the tail and head vertices, in that order).
    For example, the eleventh row ("2 13019") indicates that there is an edge directed from vertex 2 to vertex 13019.
    What are the sizes of the biggest five strongly connected components?

Challenge Dist data set:
    This file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200.
    Each row indicates the edges incident to the given vertex along with their (nonnegative) lengths.
    For example, the sixth row has a "6" as its first entry indicating that this row corresponds to vertex 6.
    The next entry of this row "141,8200" indicates that there is an undirected edge between vertex 6 and vertex 141 that has length 8200.
    The rest of the pairs in this row indicate the other vertices adjacent to vertex 6 and the lengths of the corresponding edges.
    Vertex 1 is the starting vertex.
    What are the shortest-path distances from vertex 1 to the following ten vertices?: 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197.
